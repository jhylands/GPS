# the original code

This is the code that was run on the original Trips.csv file.
All code made and used before the new year.

Each folder should have an explanation of what the code in it does.
Each folder contains *rotateDatabaseResult.py* which takes in the Trips.csv and outputs the data.json file. This file is then what all the other python analysis relies on.
