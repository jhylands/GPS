# Data
We have two sources of data. The first source is the driver, passenger, bus and walking data. This is badly labeled.
The second is my strava data which contains many bike rides and good number of runs.

Might be able to get some more running data but getting walking data might be harder

# Running SQL queries 
There is a need for me to include a standard so that I donâ€™t keep running queries off and not really understanding what it is that I have generated.

I propose that this standard is to create a folder with a meaningful name which includes all of the similar runoffs of data.
Within this folder will be folders each containing individual runoffs.
These runoff folders will each contain in them a readme of exactly what have been tried and the columns of the csv and explanations.
